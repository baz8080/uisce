# Data quality findings

Notes on data quality issues discovered while building the duration-inference pipeline, kept here so the reasoning isn't lost to chat history.

## `cases.start_date` / `cases.end_date` are not trustworthy duration signals

These are the raw `STARTDATE`/`ENDDATE` fields from the ArcGIS source feed. Investigated whether `end_date - start_date` could be used as a cheap alternative (or cross-check) to the LLM-derived duration in `inferred_cases`. Verdict: no. Across the 4,295 cases in `out/uisce.db` (2026-06-30 snapshot) with both fields populated:

- **Median difference: 3 seconds.** 69% of cases have the two timestamps within 5 minutes of each other — they look like both fields get stamped at the same administrative moment (case creation/last edit), not measured start/end of the actual works.
- **327 cases still marked `Open` already have an `end_date` populated.** If `end_date` reflected real completion, an open case shouldn't have one.
- **23 cases (0.5%) have `end_date` before `start_date`.** Invalid on its face.
- **999 more cases (23% of the total) sit within ±60 seconds of *exactly* 1 day**, with smaller clusters at 2, 3, 4, and 7 days. This pattern (excluding the near-zero bucket above) looks like a default/SLA placeholder rather than a genuine measurement — it's too concentrated on round numbers to be coincidental.
- **Cross-check against `inferred_cases.end_duration_seconds`** (the LLM-derived duration from actually reading the notice text) for the 2,500 cases with a high-confidence `completion_update` signal: only **6.6% agree within even a 1-hour tolerance**. The worst mismatches are off by hundreds of hours, and several land exactly on -30 days, -29 days, 24h, or 0h — the same clamping pattern as above, contradicting what the notice text actually says.

**Conclusion:** treat `cases.end_date` as low-trust for duration purposes by default, not as "usually fine, occasionally wrong." The near-zero and negative-diff cases (~70% of the total) are unambiguous red flags. The remaining round-day-clamped cases (~23%) can't be reliably distinguished from genuine same/next-day resolutions using this field alone — there's no clean rule that separates "really resolved in 24 hours" from "administratively defaulted to +1 day." This is why `inferred_cases` derives duration from the notice text via the LLM rather than from these fields.

## Known model-output edge cases

While computing `end_duration_seconds` (see `src/uisce/build.py`), a few real edge cases showed up in the actual data:

- `lifted_immediate` (29 cases): the prompt spec implies `local_date` should be populated for every `end_source` except `not_found`, but 10 of 29 `lifted_immediate` records have a null `local_date` anyway. Where it *is* populated, it always equals `start_date`'s calendar day. Duration for this `end_source` is stored as `NULL` regardless (an "immediately lifted" report tells you it had already resolved by report time, not how long it actually took — storing `0` would be a fabricated point estimate that could bias aggregates toward zero).
- `completion_update` can also have a missing `local_time` (100/3,527 cases) — not just `scheduled_end_date_only`. The "missing time → treat as end-of-day (23:59:59)" fallback is keyed off whether `local_time` is actually present, not off `end_source`.
- ~19 cases produce a computed end that precedes `start_date` (up to a full month earlier in one case). Given the `start_date`/`end_date` unreliability documented above, this is more likely to reflect a bad `start_date` than a bad LLM extraction, but the root cause hasn't been dug into further. These are nulled out rather than stored as negative durations.

## `start_date` looks like a publish timestamp, not an event start

Further evidence (2026-07 snapshot, 6,758 cases) that `start_date` records when staff *posted* the notice, not when the event started:

- **Hour-of-day clusters in office hours.** The top start hours are 09:00 (893), 08:00 (822), 10:00 (772), 11:00 (672), tailing off through the afternoon. Burst mains don't respect office hours; notice publishing does.
- **Day-of-week clusters mid-week.** Thursday has 1,466 starts vs Sunday's 252 (Mon 981, Tue 1,398, Wed 1,419, Fri 848, Sat 388). Again consistent with staffed publishing, not with when water infrastructure actually fails.
- This holds even for `work_type = 'Unplanned'` cases, which is the giveaway — planned works clustering in business hours would be expected; emergencies clustering there would not.

Practical consequence: `end_duration_seconds` in `inferred_cases` measures "notice published → works complete", which systematically *understates* the real outage duration for events that happened overnight or at weekends and weren't posted until the next working morning. There's no in-feed signal to correct for this; it's a floor, not a point estimate.

## Multi-pin events inflate per-case statistics

One real-world event is often published as several map pins sharing a `reference_num` (e.g. `LOU00112686`: 13 pins across Drogheda created within 22 minutes, identical title/description). 675 reference numbers cover 1,930 rows, so the 6,758 "cases" are ~5,485 distinct events. Any per-county counts or duration aggregates computed per-row weight events by pin count. Note the pins are *not* guaranteed byte-identical in description across a group (902 distinct descriptions across the 1,930 duplicate-ref rows), so deduplication by `reference_num` alone would discard real per-area updates — the inference-level dedupe keys on the description hash instead.

## `work_type` backfill from title categories

`work_type` is populated by the feed for only ~31% of cases, but titles are rigidly structured as `"Category – County"`. Where the feed *did* label cases, most categories are near-unanimously one work type (e.g. Burst Water Main: 540 Unplanned / 3 Planned). `backfill_work_type` in `src/uisce/pipeline.py` fills missing `work_type` from a static category→type map limited to categories that were ≥95% one-sided with ≥20 labelled cases; ambiguous categories (Essential Works 227P/125U, Mains Repair Works 93P/119U, Leak Detection Works, Power Outage, Mains Flushing) are deliberately left NULL. On the 2026-07 snapshot this backfills 2,547 cases, taking coverage from 31% to 68%. The map is static rather than recomputed each run to avoid a feedback loop (backfilled values feeding the next run's purity statistics) — revisit the counts manually if the feed's labelling behaviour changes.
